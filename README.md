Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Lionnes21/pc-parts-catalog.git
cd pc-parts-catalog

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.
2. Install PHP Dependencies
Install the required PHP dependencies using Composer:
composer install

This installs Laravel and other backend dependencies specified in composer.json.
3. Install Front-End Dependencies
Install Node.js dependencies for TailwindCSS and Vite:
npm install

4. Configure Environment
Copy the .env.example file to create a .env file:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=pc_parts_catalog
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

Replace your_mysql_password with your actual MySQL password. If you donâ€™t have a password, leave it empty (DB_PASSWORD=).
5. Create the Database (SQL QUERY OR DIRECTLY CREATE DB IN LOCALHOST)
CREATE DATABASE pc_parts_catalog;

php artisan key:generate

This updates the APP_KEY in your .env file, which is used for encryption and security.

This sets up the database schema for products and authentication.
